### ***Description***
#### "Hikrr" is a hiking web application. You can browse different trails, browse photos, maps and leave comments. I'm using Google Maps API to help the user find the trail head location. There's a User Authentication and the app has full CRUD functionality. You can register and after logging in you can make add hikes, photos, update them or delete them. There is a page with a timer. You can record your hiking time and save in in the app. Are you ready for your next outdoor adventure?
